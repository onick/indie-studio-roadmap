# Zero JavaScript by Default

A Hugo site is static. Every KB of JavaScript must be justified.

Prefer:
- CSS-only solutions (transitions, animations, details/summary)
- Hugo's built-in features
- Web Components if interactivity is needed
- `type="module"` or `defer` for all scripts

Never add JavaScript that could be solved with CSS or server-side rendering.
