# Front Matter Cascade for DRY

Don't repeat front matter in every page. Use `cascade` in section `_index.md` files to inherit common values:

```yaml
# content/blog/_index.md
cascade:
  type: "blog"
  params:
    show_sidebar: true
    show_toc: true
```

All child pages inherit these values unless they override them explicitly.
